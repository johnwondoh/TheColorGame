This game demonstrates the use of vanilla JavaScript for manipulation of the DOM. It focuses primarily on front-end development and does not rely on any backend technologies. It is a single page app where users are asked to select the correct colour among a set of colours based on its RGB value. 

The game has a hard and easy mode. In the hard mode, the user has to select the right colour from six different colours, while the easy mode has three colours to select from. A wrong selection will cause the colour to disappear. The right selection will turn the background of the header and all remaining colours in the set to the right colour. 

After completing a game. The user will be asked if they want to play again. If they select yes, then the game will be reinitialized with a new set of colours and a new RGB to determine.
